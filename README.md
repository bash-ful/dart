# What
a PKGBUILD for Dart SDK, sourced from the official Dart SDK archives https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive
# Why
`dart`'s official repo on arch is not updated (for reasons i do not know, some compatiblity thing maybe). i had some time, so i decided, "hey, why not make a PKGBUILD for this thing you'll probably never use, for fun"!
